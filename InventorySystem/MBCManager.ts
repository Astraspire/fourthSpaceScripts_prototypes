 * player owns the machine.  When a new activation request comes in
 * via {@link requestMBCActivation}, the manager will either grant
 * control (if no machine is active or the same player already owns
 * one) or ignore the request.  Upon granting control it broadcasts
 * a {@link changeActiveMBC} event so that all {@link MBCDrop}
 * components can show or hide themselves appropriately.  The
 * manager also listens for {@link relinquishMBC} to release the
 * current lock and hide any active machine.  Additionally, if a
 * sound pack is unlocked and no machine is currently active, the
 * manager will automatically drop the newly unlocked machine.
